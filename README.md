👋 Hi, I'm Abdul Samad an **AI Engineer** at a startup focusing on large language models and deep learning 🤖. Currently, I am a **Software Engineering student** at [NED University -UIT](https://uitu.edu.pk/), with over three years of open-source contributions 🌐. I have worked as a **Software Engineer intern** at **Google Summer of Code 2024** and the **Linux Foundation Mentorship Program 2023** 💻.
