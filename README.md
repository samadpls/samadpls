## <img src='.github/workflows/cartoon1.gif' height=35/>  About Me:


👋 Hi, I'm Abdul Samad an **AI Engineer** at a startup focusing on large language models and deep learning 🤖. I'm also a Software Engineering student at [NED University - UIT](https://uitu.edu.pk/), with over three years of open-source contributions. I have worked as a **Software Engineer intern** at **Google Summer of Code 2024** and the **Linux Foundation Mentorship Program 2023**. Additionally, I was an active member of the **Google Developer Student Club** at my campus. 

My passion for machine learning drives me to bridge the gap between technology and humanity through my contributions to the developer community 🌟.
